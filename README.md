# BoxOffice-Revenue-Prediction

In our proposed model, we analyzed post-released and pre-released features of movies. Only pre-released features are considered to predict the success of a new upcoming movie. After releasing a film, both pre-released and post-released features will be available for further study.
In this approach,we are calculating the estimated revenue of an upcoming movie based on the factors such as budget,genre and number of screens etc. For prediction ,Regression models and Ensemble models are needed to be preferred. These models are good enough to calculate numeric values.However,SVR can be used as well but it might be considered as an expensive one.We have applied Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression on our dataset for prediction.
